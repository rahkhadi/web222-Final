    <h2>Rules of Game Play</h2>
    <p>The rules of Rock Paper Scissors are simple: each player makes a hand gesture representing one of three options: rock (a closed fist), paper (an open hand), or scissors (a fist with the index and middle finger extended to resemble a pair of scissors). The winner is determined by the following rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rock beats scissors</li>
      <li>Scissors beats paper</li>
      <li>Paper beats rock</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If both players make the same gesture, the game is tied and can be played again.</p>

    <h2>Tips and Strategies for Winning</h2>
    <p>While Rock Paper Scissors is often considered a game of chance, there are some strategies you can use to increase your chances of winning:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Observe your opponent's tendencies: some players have patterns or habits when playing the game, and by observing them, you may be able to predict their next move.</li>
      <li>Try to anticipate what your opponent will play: for example, if your opponent has played rock several times in a row, they may be more likely to switch to paper or scissors next.</li>
      <li>Mix up your own moves: try not to always play the same gesture, as your opponent may catch on to your patterns.</li>
