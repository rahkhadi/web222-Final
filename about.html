                <h2>SHORT AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello there, I am Rahimullah Khadim Hussain. I have always been a huge fan of games, both indoor and outdoor, since my childhood. One of my favorite games to play with friends and family is Rock Paper Scissors. 
                    It is a simple yet fun game that requires no special equipment and can be played anywhere, anytime. That's why I decided to create this website, to share my love for this game and help others enjoy it too.

                <h2>Motive behind the website?</h2>
                <p>
                    The reason for creating this website is to spread awareness about this simple yet exciting game that can bring people together and have fun. 
                    Rock Paper Scissors is a game that transcends age, gender, and culture, making it an excellent way to bond with friends, family, and even strangers. 
                    Through this website, I aim to provide information about the game, its rules, and how to play it. Additionally, I will be sharing tips and strategies to help you win more games.
                </p>
